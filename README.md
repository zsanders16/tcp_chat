# tcp_chat

In an effort to understand how to send data from a one process to another over a plain TCP/IP connection I created a Chat Server and Client.  

### To Run
1. cd into server folder and run main.go
2. Open a new window and cd into the client folder, run main.go
3. Open as many clients a you want.
