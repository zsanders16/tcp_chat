# tcp_chat

In an effort to understand how to send data from a one process to another over a plain TCP/IP connection I created a Chat Server and Client. This is a basic server client connection, passing both text and messages back and forth.  There is no persistance of messages and clients only get messages when they are connected.

*This was more a learning exercise than about producing a working product.*

### To Run
1. cd into server folder and run main.go
2. Open a new window and cd into the client folder, run main.go
3. Open as many clients a you want.

#### TO DO:
⋅⋅* Deregister client connections
⋅⋅* Improve UI
